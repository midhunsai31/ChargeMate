# ChargeMate
This project implements an AI-driven misalignment correction system for wireless EV charging pads. The system uses computer vision (OpenCV) to detect the position of the vehicle’s coil and motorized adjustments (X, Y, and Z directions) to align the charging pad’s primary coil for optimal power transfer.
